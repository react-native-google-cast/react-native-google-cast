# react-native-google-cast

This library wraps the Google Cast SDK for Android and iOS (and, since v5, the Cast Web Sender SDK for react-native-web in Chromium browsers), providing a unified JavaScript interface.

It is written in TypeScript so types will always be up-to-date.

## Documentation

https://react-native-google-cast.github.io/docs/getting-started/installation

## Cast Videos Demo App

A React Native version of the CastVideos reference app. **Not yet ported to v5** — the v4 `example/` app was removed rather than left broken, and it returns before the 5.0.0 release. Unlike the playground, it will use the Default Media Receiver, which is what a consumer app should start from.

## Playground

Refer to the [playground](playground/) folder to find a sample app demonstrating the available APIs provided by the library.

## Expo

This library can by used by custom built Expo apps (not Expo Go) since Expo SDK 42. The config plugin is now included in this project. Follow [Installation](https://react-native-google-cast.github.io/docs/getting-started/installation#expo) and [Setup](https://react-native-google-cast.github.io/docs/getting-started/setup#expo) sections of the docs.

## Troubleshooting
