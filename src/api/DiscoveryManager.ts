/**
 * A class that manages the device discovery process.
 *
 * The framework automatically starts the discovery process when the application moves to the foreground and suspends it when the application moves to the background. On iOS, it is possible to use `startDiscovery`/`stopDiscovery`, as an optimization measure to reduce network traffic and CPU utilization in areas of the application that do not use Cast functionality.
 *
 * If the application is using the framework's Cast dialog, then that dialog will use `DiscoveryManager` to populate its list of available devices. If however the application is providing its own device selection/control dialog UI, then it should use `getDevices` and `onDevicesUpdated` to populate and update its list of available devices.
 *
 * @see [iOS](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/ios/interface_g_c_k_discovery_manager) | [Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/mediarouter/media/MediaRouter)
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import GoogleCast from 'react-native-google-cast'
 *
 * function MyComponent() {
 *   const discoveryManager = GoogleCast.getDiscoveryManager()
 *   discoveryManager.startDiscovery()
 * }
